# Dot Data Modelling Task
## Introduction
Two datasets were provided in the form of CSV files and the task is to model the data to help business users answer questions like the below:
- How many vehicles are deployed in each city/ country/ as a whole for a given day/ week?
- How many vehicles are lost in each city/ country/ as a whole for a given day/week?
- What is the 14-day running lost percentage (total loss vehicles in the D-21 and D-7 divided by the average deployed vehicles in the same period) in each city/country as a whole for a given day?
- How many vehicles with battery level are less than 20% in each city â€¦.?

## Dataset
### Telemetry
This dataset was provided in a csv file named ***data_modelling_test_tbl_telemetry.csv***. It contains records of periodic gps signals received by Dott's vehicles; it also contains data on the vehicle's battery level and whether or not the vehicle is being charged at that particular moment. Typically, a vehicle will have several records in an hour (roughly every 15 minutes).

### State
This dataset was provided in a csv file named ***data_modelling_test_tbl_states.csv***. It contains information about the state of vehicles and what city/country they are being operated out of. There are three possible states a vehicle can have; ***is_deployed***, ***is_broken***, ***is_in_warehouse***. Typically, a vehicle will have several records in an hout (roughly every 15 minutes).

## Tools used
- HDFS
- HIVE
- PRESTO
 
 ***The steps on how to load the CSV files attached for this test using the tools above is given in loading_csv_steps.md***
 
 ## APPROACH TO THE TASK
 After studying the data and the business questions, I made the below decisions on the data modelling:
 
 ### Telemetry
 I decided to model this as a ***snapshot fact table*** that shows the status of every vehicle at the end of every day. The field that determines the date is the ***time_gps*** field. The reason for this was because a lot of the business questions seemed to focus on ***activities that happened in a given day/week***. As a result, it appears that the business will get the most value from having the data modelled on at least a daily grain.
 
 ### State
 I decided to model this as a ***Type 2 Slowly Changing Dimension***.
